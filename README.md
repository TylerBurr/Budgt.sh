### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Terminal with color support (most modern terminals)

## üéÆ Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `a` - Add new account
- `t` - Add new transaction
- `Shift+T` - Transfer money between accounts
- `Ctrl+T` - Toggle theme
- `Left/Right` - Expand account/transaction panels
- `r` - Reset layout to default
- `q` - Quit application

### Getting Started
1. **Create accounts** first using `a` - add your bank accounts, credit cards, etc.
2. **Add transactions** with `t` - record income and expenses
3. **Transfer money** between accounts with `Shift+T`
4. **View insights** in the bottom panel for spending analysis

## üîí Security & Data Protection

### Local Data Storage
Your financial data is stored **locally** in an SQLite database (`budgt.db`) and never transmitted over the network.

### Protecting Your Data

#### File Permissions
Restrict database access to your user only:
```bash
chmod 600 budgt.db
```

#### Backup Strategy
Regular encrypted backups are recommended:
```bash
# Create encrypted backup
gpg -c budgt.db

# Restore from backup
gpg -d budgt.db.gpg > budgt.db
```

#### System Security
- **Use full disk encryption** on your device
- **Keep your system updated** with security patches
- **Use strong user account passwords**
- **Consider encrypted home directory** for additional protection

### Privacy Features
- ‚úÖ **No network communication** - purely offline application
- ‚úÖ **No telemetry or tracking** - your data stays private
- ‚úÖ **No cloud dependencies** - complete local control
- ‚úÖ **Open source** - transparent and auditable code

### Input Validation
The application includes comprehensive input validation:
- Amount limits (max $999M per transaction)
- Description length limits (200 characters)
- Account name validation (100 characters max)
- Duplicate account name prevention
- Positive amount enforcement for transfers
